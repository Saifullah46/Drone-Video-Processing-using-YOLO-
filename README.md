# 🚁 Drone Video Processing using YOLO (FREE AI Version )

## 📌 Overview

This project processes drone footage using **YOLOv8** to detect objects such as animals, vehicles, and humans, and generates real-time insights **without using any paid APIs**.

The system outputs a processed video with bounding boxes, labels, and AI-generated summaries — making it suitable for real-world applications like agriculture monitoring, surveillance, and traffic analysis.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drone-video-yolo.git
cd drone-video-yolo

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. Add your video inside the `input/` folder
2. Rename it to:

```bash
sample_video.mp4
```

3. Run the project:

```bash
python detect.py
```

---

## 📁 Output

Processed video will be saved in:

```bash
outputs/output.avi
```

### Output includes:

* 🟩 Bounding boxes
* 🏷 Object labels with confidence
* 🔴 AI-generated summary text

## 💡 Key Highlight

👉 This project **eliminates dependency on paid APIs** by implementing a rule-based AI summarization system.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Detection accuracy depends on YOLO model
* Processing may be slow on low-end systems
* Rule-based AI is simpler than advanced LLMs

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* 🌐 Web App (Flask / Streamlit)
* 🎥 Real-time webcam detection
* 📊 Dashboard for analytics
* 🔥 Instagram Reel-style output
* 🧠 Integration with local LLMs
